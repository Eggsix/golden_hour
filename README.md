Getting Started 
 - clone repository
 - run $npm -i
 - run $npm start dev

I built this project in Vite which is pretty fast and responsive. In a nutshell when it's compiled, the code namespaces are reduced to single characters
so the files are really tiny. One of the pitfalls is that when you use an npm package it won't work properly so there's still a few kings that need to 
be worked out. 
It is built with typescript which for this I wish I hadn't because most of the time spent was on type checking and then I decided it part way through
that in the interest of time I would just cheat some of it.
I did use react and for the most part I've tried to implement the S.O.L.I.D principles I've learned recently.

-Single responsibility principle (SRP)
-Open-closed principle (OCP)
-Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
-Interface segregation principle (ISP)
-Dependency inversion principle (DIP)

time spent: 4 hours within the span two days
